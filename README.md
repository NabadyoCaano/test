This plot shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy at birth for 195 countries in 2019, based on data from the World Bank. The plot uses a logarithmic scale for the x-axis to show the wide range of income levels across countries, and a linear scale for the y-axis to show the variation in life expectancy. The plot shows a clear positive correlation between the two variables, meaning that countries with higher income tend to have longer lives. However, there are also some outliers that deviate from this trend, such as Qatar, which has a very high income but a relatively low life expectancy, or Japan, which has a moderate income but a very high life expectancy. The plot also uses color to indicate the continent of each country, showing that there are regional differences in both income and life expectancy. For example, Africa has many countries with low income and low life expectancy, while Europe has many countries with high income and high life expectancy. The plot also labels some of the most extreme cases, such as Monaco, which has the highest life expectancy in the world (86.8 years), or South Sudan, which has the lowest (52.8 years).

This plot follows some of the principles of @EdwardTufte's style of data visualization, such as:

- Using minimal ink to convey maximum information
- Avoiding unnecessary clutter and decoration
- Using color sparingly and meaningfully
- Labeling data points directly rather than using legends or keys
- Providing clear titles and captions
